user_description: Hi, my name is Kelvin Guan. I'm a third-year student currently studying for my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine. I enjoy working on various side projects that allow me to express my creativity or to expand my knowledge on a certain skillset. Most of my experience is in C++ and Python. I also have good exposure to MySQL, Java, and x86 Assembly. Mainly looking for Software Engineering, Database Administration, Project Management, and IT roles in both the public and private sector. I am always eager to tackle any challenge that may come my way; no task is too difficult.
